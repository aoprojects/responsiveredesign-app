		<h3>Timeline</h3>
		<p>Most projects take just a week to actually develop.</p>
		<p>We are able to do this because we work with you, the client, before beginning development work to make sure we have everything we need - new website copy, updated images, new feature requests, etc.</p>
		<p>Only once we are sure we have what we need, we start.</p>
