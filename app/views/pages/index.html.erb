            <h2>Why is mobile responsive so important?</h2>

            <h3>Static Websites Damage Sales</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bounce rates in excess of 50%: most customers leave your site ASAP</li>
                <li>Second most common reason for leaving a site, only behind slow loading</li>
                <li>1 in 3 customers abandon a purchase due to the annoyance of a static site</li>
                <li>69% of customers prefer to order online than over the phone </li>
                <li>55% of all e-commerce interactions taking place on smartphones</li>
                <li>42% of customers will post a poor review, vs just 24% over the phone [what does this one mean?]</li>
                <li>[waste of time and money to have a separate site for each mobile, tablet, deskto.] [Number of different devices that represent different screen sizes]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Having a fully responsive website has never been more critical.</p>

            <h3>Benefits Of Responsive Websites</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce your bounce rate to less than 20% (Forbes)
                <li>User feel like you are a modern company who is always ready for them, wherever device they’re on.  This means they feel they can trust your brand.
                <li>Customers can interact with you quickly, rather than put your site on a list to ‘deal with later’ when they’re at a desktop.
            </ul>

            <h2>Your options - How to update your site</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><u>Option 1:</u>&nbsp;Do it yourself. You can use a template engine. They cost time to edit, money per feature (like custom domains), and they offer limited pre-set functionality. They also often hiden their back end code, which means you'll have to hire an expensive design agency ($5,000 minimums are common) to hack around the template's limitations.</li>
                <li><u>Option 2:</u>&nbsp;Hire a super cheap offshore design agency. This is great if you want just text edited, or a couple of colors changed. But we wouldn't recommend this option if you want to get the job done quickly and place your trust in the hands of a stranger. American standards are just different. Mamy offshore agencies seem to get it just a bit wrong. They etc.  hey often get the little things just a bit wrong. <br> 
                Examples of not-so-great things we've seen when working with offshore designers:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Offer an older design style, by using antiquated HTML tags, or by writing their styling inline instead of in a stylesheet (much harder to edit later), or by using tables to create columns instead of floating rows that truly respond to the width of your browser</li>
                        <li>Strange word use, like "telephony" instead of "Telephone"</li>
                        <li>Create a responsive site that doesn't interact with the customer by not using CSS animations to make the elements of your site slide in or out with scrolling. 
                        <br>Hint: It's <strong>movement</strong> makes a site modern, and we put this into every site we can.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><u>Option 4:</u> Hire an expensive agency that's been around for a while.<br> 
                    They'll get the job done - for $5,000 - $10,000 at least. THey'll also do time-sucking things like make wireframes, design a new color pallete, redesign your logo, rebrand your social sites, conduct user focus groups, and do A/B testing with keyword research. </li>
                <li><u>Option 4:</u>&nbsp;Hire Responsive Redesign. <br>
                    Your new, custom, mobilee responsive site can be uploaded live to your custom domain, with your custom features, in a week or less – for cheap.</li>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>As a busy small business owner, creating a new website is a dramatic undertaking without professional help. I was recommended to Virgo Ventures by a business associate and was not only pleased with the organization and planning of our personal contact, Alison but also the simplified way in which she explained what she was doing based on our wish list and IT needs.</p>
                    <p>Our transition from old site to new was practically seamless and we have already seen a huge boost in our website traffic as well as reduction in band width usage.</p> 
                    <p>At the end, we now have an amazing responsive website that functions as good as it looks. I would highly recommend Virgo Ventures for any website creation or update work.</p>
